# Alberta Map App

A proof of concept for loading csv data into Unity and displaying it with an interactive map. Colours for each district correspond to their respective values on a gradient scale.

Selecting a district causes the region to glow yellow and open a sliding tab with the corresponding District Number displayed. Running the time series causes the district colours to animate the csv values over the entire array.
